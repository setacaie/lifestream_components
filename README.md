# Lifestream Components
This mod adds some extra features to the Lifestream modpack for Minecraft 1.20.1. They are designed for the official server, so you will probably not find much use for them.

## What does this mod actually add?
- A creative tab called "Lifestream Components"
- Copper, Silver, Gold, Diamond, and Netherite Gil coins.
- Shinra Contractor ID

## Why wouldn't I find this useful?
These items are designed to work with the quest datapack installed on the offical server. They are not craftable, and serve no other purpose. As such, unless you have those quests, you aren't really going to find anything this modpack adds to be of any use whatsoever.

## Are the quests not released to the general public?
At the moment, no.

## Can I use this anyway?
Knock yourself out. Give credit though - a link to this github, or to the curseforge page, or a name drop.

## Was this made with MCreator?
Yeah.
